                        Programmers need to be tech-savvy, creative, and have strong analytical and problem-solving skills. They also need to be patient and enjoy using logic to solve complex problems. 
                        <br><br>
                        Programmers can learn through a four-year degree program at a university or college with a recognized IT program and math department. They can also complete a boot camp, which is an intensive program that teaches coding languages, testing techniques, and computer security principles.
