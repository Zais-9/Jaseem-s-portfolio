                <p><b>Analog Wall-clock:--</b>
                    <br> It is a device that displays the current time using moving hands and a circular dial marked with hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds. It's called “analog” because it represents time through continuous, physical motion, as opposed to digital clocks that use numerical displays. An analogue clock has a clock face with a dial of numbers from 1 to 12. It uses an hour hand and a minute hand that rotate in a clockwise direction around the numbers to show the time. On an analogue clock, the longer hand shows the minutes and the shorter hand shows the An analog clock is a tool for reading the time of day. The longest hand indicates the seconds, the longer one indicates the minutes while the smallest one indicates the hours. The shortest hand indicates the hour, a longer hand indicates the minutes, and the longest arm indicates the seconds.

These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper scissors"-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan.
